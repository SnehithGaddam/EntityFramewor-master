# Bulk SaveChanges

## Description

The EF `BulkSaveChanges` extension method execute bulk operations from entries to save.

```csharp

context.BulkSaveChanges();

// Easy to customize
context.BulkSaveChanges(options => options.BatchSize = 100);
```

### FAQ

#### Why BatchSaveChanges is faster than SaveChanges?
The `SaveChanges` method makes it quite slow/impossible to handle a scenario that requires to save a lot of entities due to the number of database round-trips required. The `SaveChanges` perform one database round-trip for every entity to insert. So, if you need to insert 10,000 entities, 10,000 database round-trips will be performed which is **INSANELY** slow.

The `BulkSaveChanges` in counterpart requires the minimum database round-trips as possible. By using Bulk Operations, fewer commands are executed which lead to better performance.

#### When should I use BulkSaveChanges over SaveChanges?
Whenever you have more than one entity to save. The `BulkSaveChanges` is almost as fast as the `SaveChanges` for one entity, but becomes way faster as the number of entities to save grows.

#### When should I use BulkSaveChanges over BatchSaveChanges?
`BatchSaveChanges` become slower and slower in comparisons to `BulkSaveChanges` when the number of entities to save grows due to the `ChangeTracker`.

After a few thousands of entities, we recommend using `BulkSaveChanges` which is a more scalable solution.
